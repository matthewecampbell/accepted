# Accepted
Accepted is a college search app meant to be used by high school students to help them find a college that fits their needs.  You may log in using Facebook OAuth and then input your criteria for a college and it will recommend colleges to you.

This is a personal project that I worked on for one week in my third module at Turing School of Software and Design.  The project required me to consume an external API.  I ended up created [my own API](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/accepted_api) and consuming it.

## Usage
* Clone the project
```
git clone git@github.com:matthewecampbell/accepted.git
```
* `cd` into the project directory:
```
cd accepted
```
Run bundle:
```
bundle
```
To start the server:
```
rails s
```
Visit localhost:3000 to run the app on your machine.
